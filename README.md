# DICE Continuous Integration

## Introduction

The Continuous Integration service provides regular, scheduled or event-based running of tools that are important in the DIA development, testing and deployment lifecycle. In the development process, performance improvements or regressions show as a speed-up or slow-down, measured in performance metrics. Having a way of visualizing performance changes helps assess validity of changes in DIA development.

The DICE Jenkins plug-in adds a project post-build step, which stores the build's performance output that is created as a JSON file by each build. The JSON file may contain any performance metric such as a duration of a batch operation, average or maximum operation latency, etc.

The work is a part of the [DICE] project results. In February 2017, we had the
tools' intermediate release. We accompanied it with the D5.2 DICE delivery
tools - intermediate version project deliverable, which provides the motivation
for the tools and further details.
